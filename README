Apache Check
===============================================
http://github.com/MorbosVermin/Apache-Check

A small, PHP-based library and application to check Apache configurations
for common security issues. The script loads a XML-based ruleset (by
default rhel-centos-based Apache configurations) and then uses a library
to parse the Apache configuration and check the directives parsed.

This script can be added to a continuous build process using tools like 
Jenkins. The normal output of the script is suppressed for this reason, but 
the return/exit code indicates the score of the audit.

  o src/Apache.lib.php:    Library to parse Apache configurations.
  o src/XmlRules.lib.php:  Small XML library for the XML-based ruleset(s).
  o src/apache_check.php:  Apache-Check script/application

Usage
=================

  # apache-check -f <path to httpd.conf>
  (Results will not be displayed, 'echo $?' to see return code indicating score)
  
  # apache-check -f <path> -v
  (Verbose output including score)
  
  # apache-check -f <path> [-r <alternate ServerRoot>] [-v [> results.log]]
  # apache-check -h

Results and Scores
=================

At the end of the audit process, you will be presented with a score and any issues 
found. The score is cumulative and should not be relied upon as a "end-all" for 
Security checks. However, this tool will catch many common issues with Apache 
configurations and the score should be used to indicate these common issues. 

1-4 - Non-critical, can be ignored most of the time.
  
5-8 - Medium criticality
  
9+  - High criticality. 

  
XML Rules
=================

This tool uses an XML file to load rules which will be processed on the 
configuration(s) parsed. You can create new XML rule sets by following the general 
rule of the centos-rhel-httpd.xml file given. 

To run the tool with an alternative rule set...

  # apache_check.php -f <path> -x <path to XML rule set file>
